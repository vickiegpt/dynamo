# This is a simple load test script for the planner component. To validate
# 1. Run 1P1D (default disagg router setup)
# 2. Start planner with python components/planner.py --namespace dynamo --decode-kv-scale-up-threshold 0.2 --decode-kv-scale-down-threshold 0.1 --adjustment-interval 10
# 3. Run ./load_test.sh 100
# Expected behavior is scale up to 1P2D and then back down to 1P1D
