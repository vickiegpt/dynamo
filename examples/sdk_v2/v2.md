# Goals

p0s:
- Components should be authored as classes
- Components should be runnable with python3
- component serving should be without bloat

p1:
- components should expose core bindings for serving in some cases

## Proposal

In the following section I'll iterate through variations that show how different personas with different needs can use the SDK. default user -> mixed user -> total control user.

### Persona 1: Default User

```python
from dynamo.sdk import serve, service, endpoint

@service(
    name="worker",
    namespace="dynamo",
)
class Worker():
    def __init__(self):
        ...

    @endpoint()
    async def generate(self, request: ChatRequest):
        yield "token1"
        yield "token2"
        yield "token3"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    import uvloop

    asyncio.run(serve(Worker))
```

Solves:
- can now run a component with python3

What is happening under the hood:
- serve() is serving my endpoints for me

What do we need to add next?
- Ability to give access to the runtime, endpoints, component back to the user

### Persona 2: Mixed User (wants access to dist runtime)

Example: I want to use the runtime to create clients directly to other services on the runtime.

```python
from dynamo.sdk import serve, service, endpoint, DynamoContext

@service(
    name="worker",
    namespace="dynamo",
)
class Router():
    # dynamo context injected by serve()
    def __init__(self, dynamo_context: DynamoContext):
        self.runtime = dynamo_context.runtime

    @async_init
    async def async_init(self):
        # e.g generate a direct client to the worker from the router
        self.worker_client = self.runtime.namespace(self.namespace).component("worker").endpoint("generate").client()

    @endpoint()
    async def generate(self, request: ChatRequest):
        # call the client to worker
        for token in self.worker_client.generate(request):
            yield token

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    import uvloop

    # serve now injects the DynamoContext since it's a named argument in the constructor
    asyncio.run(serve(Router))

# ... Defined in the sdk else where
# Typed 
class DynamoContext(BaseModel):
    runtime: DistributedRuntime
    component: Component
    endpoints: List[Endpoint]
    name: str
    namespace: str
``` 

Solves:
- giving user access to the runtime, component, endpoints without a global dynamo_context dict
    - user can introspect serve() function to see how this injection is happening
    - extremely clear when dynamo_context is populated, since it is being injected

What is happening under the hood:
- serve() is still serving my endpoints for me
- serve() creates a DynamoContext instance and injects it into the constructor

What do we need to add next?
- what if I want total control over how the endpoints are served and don't want anything to happen automatically? What if I want visibility into the bindings that are facilitating the serving of the component and not have that hidden behind a serve() function?

### Persona 3: Power user: Total control over how the endpoints are served and don't want anything to happen automatically. 

Wants top level code to use raw bindings to serve component. Might also want to pass args and kwargs from top level to the constructor

```python
from dynamo.sdk import serve, service, endpoint, DynamoContext

@service(
    name="worker",
    namespace="dynamo",
)
class Router():
    def __init__(self, dynamo_context: DynamoContext, engine_args: ServerArgs):
        self.ctx = dynamo_context
        self.engine_args = engine_args

    # @entrypoint decorator allows a user to totally override how the component will be served leaving everything to the user
    # specifying it means that components/endpoints will not automatically be served
    @entrypoint
    async def entrypoint(self):
        # CORE BINDINGS: Visibility into the bindings that are facilitating the serving of the component
        # Delegates full control back to the user
        # Allows the user to do everything manually
        await self.ctx.component.create_service()
        await self.ctx.component.endpoint("generate").serve_endpoint(self.generate)
    
    # no endpoint decorator since entrypoint is directly registering this function
    async def generate(self, request: ChatRequest):
        # call the client to worker
        for token in self.worker_client.generate(request):
            yield token

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    import uvloop

    # pass args and kwargs to the constructor
    engine_args = parse_sglang_args()

    asyncio.run(serve(Router, engine_args=engine_args))
``` 

Solves:
- core bindings are exposed, just not in the footer, but cleanly encapsulated in the component
- user can now see how the component is actually being served

## Definition of serve

To meet our goal of keeping the serving API super simple, it should simply look like the following

```python
from dynamo.runtime import DistributedRuntime, dynamo_worker

async def serve(service_class: Type, runtime: DistributedRuntime = None):
    # 1. Create a runtime/dyn worker if one is not passed
    # 2. Init the context
    # 3. Init the inner class injecting the context
    # 4. Run async init to do any async setup
    # 5. Use default entrypoint or user passed entrypoint if one is decorated
```
