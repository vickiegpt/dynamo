        The function determines this by selecting any request and iterating
        through its blocks.  A block is considered a common prefix block if its
        `ref_cnt` equals the total number of requests in the RUNNING state.

        NOTE(woosuk): The number of requests in the RUNNING state is **greater
        than or equal to** the number of requests scheduled in the current step.
        This is because the RUNNING state only indicates that:
        1. The request has not yet finished, and
        2. The request holds its blocks unfreed.

        While all scheduled requests must be in the RUNNING state, the inverse
        is not necessarily true. There may be RUNNING requests that are not
        scheduled in the current step.

        This can result in an edge case where the number of common prefix blocks
        is 0, even though all scheduled requests share a common prefix. This
        occurs because there may be unscheduled RUNNING requests that do not
        share the common prefix. Currently, this case cannot be easily detected,
        so the function returns 0 in such cases.
